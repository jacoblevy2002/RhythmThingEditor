# RhythmThingEditor

**RhythmThingEditor** is a level editor designed for the [RhythmThing](https://github.com/Reaxt/RhythmThing) game created by [Rea Koehler](https://reaxt.github.io). It was created in collaboration with her.

The app features a wavelength editor, with options to add button targets at any point in the chosen song. The user has full control over any element accessed by RhythmThing (such as BPM), with an in-depth tutorial included in the app. There's also a game launcher included directly in the level maker, allowing you to easily play-test your level during development.

This project was created in December 2021 as the final project for a Programming class.

## Dependencies
The level editor relies on RhythmThing already being installed on your device before running.
